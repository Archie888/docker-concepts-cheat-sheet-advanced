# Docker Concepts Advanced Cheat Sheet

A concise reference for core Docker concepts, commands, and workflows.  
This cheat sheet summarizes the essential ideas and commands that help you understand how Docker works and how to use it effectively.

## 📦 Core Docker Concepts

### 1. **Image**
- A snapshot/blueprint of an application and its environment.
- Built from a Dockerfile.
- Immutable (doesn’t change after it’s built).
- **Example:** `node:18`, `postgres:16`, or your custom `mycompany/base-server`.
- Occupies **disk space only** — not loaded into RAM unless a container is started.
  - Stored on disk in the Docker engine’s storage backend (e.g., `/var/lib/docker` on Linux).
  - On Windows/macOS, Docker runs in a lightweight Linux VM, and images are stored inside the VM’s disk volume.
- Removed by `docker system prune` **if** unused (i.e., not referenced by any container).

### 2. **Container**
- A running instance of an image.
- Isolated from the host and other containers.
- Has its own filesystem, processes, and network.
- Multiple containers can be created from the same image.
- Runs in **RAM** while active — loaded from the image and runs processes in memory.
  - When started, the image is used as a base and a temporary *writable layer* is added on top (stored on disk).
  - The container’s layered filesystem is stored alongside the image data in Docker’s internal storage (e.g., `/var/lib/docker/containers` on Linux).
- When stopped, the container's **memory is freed**, but its **writable layer on disk remains** unless the container is removed.
- For **persistent data**, containers use **volumes** (see section on Volumes) — volumes are not tied to the image and survive container deletion.
- On Windows/macOS, the container runs inside a lightweight **Linux VM**. Both disk and memory usage happen within that VM.
- Stopped containers are deleted by `docker system prune` (unless explicitly kept).

### 3. **Dockerfile**
- A script with instructions to build a Docker image.
- Defines base image, files to copy, commands to run, etc.

### 4. **Docker Compose**
- Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- Uses a `docker-compose.yml` file to specify services, networks, and volumes.

### 5. **Registry**
- Storage and distribution system for Docker images.
- **Examples:** Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, AWS ECR.

## 🗄️ Persistent Storage

### 6. **Volume**
- A persistent storage mechanism managed by Docker.
- Used by containers to store data that should survive container restarts or deletion.
- Volumes are **not part of the image** — they are **mounted separately** and hold external data (like databases or uploads).
- Stored on **disk**, typically under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` on Linux.
- On Windows/macOS, volumes are stored inside the Docker Linux VM’s disk volume.
- Commonly used for databases, user uploads, and logs.
- Unused volumes (not referenced by any container) are removed by `docker system prune --volumes`.

**Example (in `docker-compose.yml`):**
  ```
  volumes:
    - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  ```

- Managed with commands like:
  ```
  docker volume ls
  docker volume inspect <volume_name>
  ```


### 7. **Bind Mount**
- Maps a directory or file from your host machine directly into the container.
- Changes on the host are reflected in the container (and vice versa).
- Great for development (e.g., mount your source code for live editing).

**Example (in `docker-compose.yml`):**
  ```
  volumes:
    - .:/usr/src/app
  ```

## 🌐 Networking Concepts

### 8. **Network**
- Allows Docker containers to communicate with each other.
- By default, Compose creates a network for your app’s services.
- You can define custom networks for more control.
- Docker networks are virtual constructs, but their configuration is stored on disk (e.g., `/var/lib/docker/network/` on Linux).
- Unused custom networks (not used by any container) are removed by `docker system prune`.

## 🔄 Lifecycle & Management

### 9. **Build**
- Creates a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  docker build -t myimage .
  ```

### 10. **Run**
- Starts a container from an image.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  docker run myimage
  ```

### 11. **Pull / Push**
- Download or upload images from/to a registry.
- **Commands:**
  ```bash
  docker pull <image>
  docker push <image>
  ```

### 12. **Exec**
- Run a command inside a running container.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  docker exec -it <container> bash
  ```

## 💽 Disk Usage & Cleanup

- **Images** consume the most disk space — especially large base images or many image versions.
  - ⚠️ It's common for a small project to consume multiple gigabytes — e.g., 1.5 GB per image is typical for server or database containers.
    - Example: A simple project with a web server and PostgreSQL can easily take **3 GB or more**, just from shared public images.
    -  Docker is a great way to streamline development with portable, ready-to-go environments — just make sure you have plenty of disk space available!

- **Containers** use a writable layer on disk that grows over time (e.g., logs, temp files).
- **Volumes** store persistent data (e.g., databases, file uploads) and can grow large.
- **Networks** are virtual, but their configurations are stored on disk (e.g., `/var/lib/docker/network/` on Linux).
- **Dangling images**, **stopped containers**, **unused volumes**, and **unused networks** can accumulate over time.

### 🔍 How to check disk usage
```bash
docker system df
```

### 🧹 How to clean up unused resources
```bash
docker system prune
docker system prune --volumes  # Also removes unused volumes
```

> ⚠️ Use with care! Prune deletes *everything* unused — including stopped containers and untagged images.
